NAME

us_split
an xkb keyboard layout


ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

A keyboard layout for xkb. Geared specifically towards reducing RSI,
this layout is nearly identical to QWERTY, except there is a two-key
split between the T and Y columns into which symbols from the furthest
right of each row are placed. This way, the hands can assume a more
natural position (sort of like with Dvorak) and hitting enter is not a
contortionist exercise any more.

The problem with QWERTY is, among others, that the right hand needs to
move a lot -- especially in the wrist -- which can lead to Repetitive
Strain Injury. If you spend a lot of time typing, you should be aware
of this and should know that you might be hurting yourself with an
inappropriate keyboard layout. This layout makes it easy for people to
try out something new, while alleviating some important issues.


The changes can be seen easily at the diagrams below:

Normal QWERTY:

     ` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = BBBB
    Tab q w e r t y u i o p [ ] RRR
    Caps a s d f g h j k l ; ' \ RR
    SSS < z x c v b n m , . / SSSSS
    CCC W AAA __________ AA RC CCCC


This layout:

     ` 1 2 3 4 5 - = 6 7 8 9 0 BBBB
    Tab q w e r t [ ] y u i o p RRR
    Caps a s d f g \ ' h j k l ; RR
    SSS B z x c v , . b n m / SSSSS
    CCC W Alt __________ AA RC CCCC

The key between the left Shift and z is the 105th key, and is a second
Backspace. It exists on many European keyboards and some people love it,
while some people hate it with their whole essence. The author has been
a member of both groups.

Naturally, this can be used with GNOME's keyboard layout options in order
to turn the Caps Lock key into another Escape, Control, or Meta key.


INSTALLATION

In order to install the layout under Ubuntu 10.04, use the included
install.py script which will take care of the rest. This should work
in newer versions as well, however has not been tested with the Unity
desktop or KDE and might not work in them. This version has only been
tested with GNOME under Ubuntu 10.04. Installation should not require
restarting the X server.

In order to install on other systems, you might need to change the
options of the installer. See ./install.py --help for a description of
the options. Specifically, the xkb directory might have moved. You are
searching for a directory called 'xkb' with subdirectories including
'rules' and 'symbols', as well as a few others. You might also need
to change the name of the xml file, normally rules/evdev.xml is used
on Ubuntu 10.04 but it might be rules/xfree86.xml or rules/base.xml
or rules/xorg.xml.

On some systems .lst files with the same base names are used instead.
Those files are not supported by the installer, however editing them by
hand should be fairly easy: in the !layout section you would add the line:

us_split  USA Split

Then, you should put the us_split file in the symbols/
subdirectory. Finally, a restart of your X server might be required. This
has, however, not been tested.


USAGE

In order to use the layout, under GNOME you would use the program
gnome-keyboard-properties(1) which can normally be accessed in the
System menu, Preferences submenu. Alternatively, it can be run from the
terminal. Then, in the Layouts tab, you would click the Add button and
navigate to the By Language tab. In this tab, select English as the
language and then find USA Split in the Variants dropdown. Finally,
click Add. You can then select the layout from the list.


STABILITY

Note that the layout may change (even drastically!) in the future. Older
versions should be available from the usual sources.
